# Hi, I'm Mathiou 👋                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                     
  Senior Software Engineer & Team Lead based in Athens, Greece 🇬🇷.

  I've spent 12+ years building web and mobile products — from early-stage MVPs
  to large-scale platforms — leading teams and getting things shipped.

  I recently went **freelance**. I work with startups, product teams, and
  companies that need senior engineering, technical leadership, or a partner
  to take a product from idea to production.
