### Hi there. I'm Theodore.
Friends call me 'Mathiou'.

I am from Greece. I love 📖, 🗺, ☀️, 🌊, 🏄🏻‍♂️, ⛺️.
I also love coding (obviously) and 'Track and Field'. Thus, other than my full time job (currently software engineer on travel industry),
I spend my time trying to build something meaningful for the track and field community (till now I have fail greatly 😅).
Also, trying to play around with new technologies (latest things Tensorflow, GraphQL)
