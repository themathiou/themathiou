### Hi there 👋. I'm Theodore 🇬🇷.
Friends call me 'Mathiou'.

- 👔 I’m currently working on [Anixe](https://anixe.io/) as a Front-End Engineer and Team Leader. We are working with latest *Angular*, *Java* and *PostgreSQL*.
- 🏟 I’m currently creating [trackandfield.io](https://trackandfield.io). A digital platform for Track and Field data and statistics using *React*, *GraphQL* and *MongoDB*. For previous failures 😅 please see: [Trafie](https://www.trafie.com) 
- I post stuff on [Medium](https://mathiou.medium.com)
- I like learning new things, reading, hiking, spend time with my beloved ones and explore new places.
